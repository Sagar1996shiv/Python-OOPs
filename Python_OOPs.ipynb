        "1.  What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        " - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects,\" which are instances of classes. These objects can contain both data (attributes or properties) and functions (methods or behaviors).\n",
        "\n",
        " 2.  What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "  - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Points About a Class:\n",
        "\n",
        " It encapsulates data for the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "It defines behaviors via methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "It supports reusability and modularity.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        " - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete entity that has:\n",
        "\n",
        "     State (stored in attributes or properties)\n",
        "\n",
        "     Behavior (defined by methods)\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        " - ðŸ”¹ Abstraction\n",
        "Definition: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: To reduce complexity and focus on what an object does instead of how it does it.\n",
        "\n",
        "How: Through abstract classes, interfaces, or methods that only define a behavior without implementing it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: You can drive a car without knowing how the engine works.\n",
        "\n",
        "ðŸ”¹ Encapsulation\n",
        "Definition: Bundling data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit, and restricting access to some of the object's components.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: To protect the internal state of an object from unintended or harmful changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "How: By using access modifiers (private, protected, public) and getter/setter methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: You canâ€™t directly access a carâ€™s fuel injection system; you use the gas pedal instead.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        " - Dunder methods (short for \"double underscore\" methods, also called magic methods) in Python are special methods with names that start and end with double underscores (__like_this__). They are used to define or customize the behavior of objects for built-in Python operations like printing, adding, or comparing objects.\n",
        "\n",
        " 6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "  - Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (child or subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods and attributes) from another class (parent or superclass).\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose of Inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "Code reuse â€“ avoid rewriting common code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Extensibility â€“ build on existing functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism support â€“ same interface, different behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        " - Polymorphism means \"many forms.\" It allows objects of different classes to be treated through the same interface, while each class can define its own specific behavior for that interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        " - Encapsulation is the concept of hiding the internal state of an object and restricting direct access to some of its components. Itâ€™s achieved in Python using:\n",
        "\n",
        "     Private and protected attributes\n",
        "\n",
        "     Getter and setter methods\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        " - A constructor in Python is a special method called __init__() that is automatically invoked when a new object (instance) of a class is created. It is used to initialize the object's attributes (i.e., assign values to them) when the object is created.\n",
        "\n",
        " 10. What are class and static methods in Python>\n",
        " - class methods and static methods are special types of methods that are bound to a class rather than an instance of the class. They are used in different situations and serve distinct purposes.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  A class method is bound to the class itself, not the instance. It can modify the class state that applies to all instances of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        " A static method does not depend on the class or instance. It does not take self or cls as its first parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        " 11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "  - Method overloading is a concept where you define multiple methods in a class with the same name but with different parameters. This allows a method to behave differently based on the number or type of arguments passed to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, Python does not support method overloading in the traditional sense (as seen in languages like Java or C++). In Python, if you define multiple methods with the same name, the last definition will overwrite the previous ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        " - Method overriding is a feature in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where a child class provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "When the method in the child class has the same name, same parameters, and same return type as the method in the parent class, it is said to override the parentâ€™s method.\n",
        "\n",
        "The child class method will be called instead of the parent class method when you invoke that method on an instance of the child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        " - The @property decorator in Python is used to define a method that behaves like an attribute. It allows you to define a method that can be accessed like a regular attribute (i.e., without calling it explicitly with parentheses), but with the flexibility of adding logic for getting, setting, or deleting the value.\n",
        "\n",
        " 14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "  - ðŸ”¹ Importance of Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
        "Polymorphism, which means \"many forms,\" is one of the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows different objects to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface, even if they belong to different types or classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.  What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        " - An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It is meant to be inherited by other classes, and it often contains abstract methods â€” methods that are declared but contain no implementation in the abstract class itself. Instead, they must be implemented by the subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstract classes are used to define a common interface for a group of related classes, ensuring that certain methods are implemented in the subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        " - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers several key benefits that make it a popular and powerful paradigm for organizing and managing complex software projects. Here are the primary advantages of using OOP:\n",
        " 1. Modularity (Code Reusability)\n",
        " 2. Encapsulation (Data Hiding)\n",
        " 3. Inheritance (Extensibility)\n",
        " 4. Polymorphism (Flexibility and Interoperability)\n",
        " 5. Easier Maintenance and Debugging\n",
        " 6. Improved Collaboration and Scalability\n",
        "\n",
        " 17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "  - 1. Class Variable\n",
        "A class variable is a variable that is shared by all instances (objects) of a class. It is defined inside the class but outside of any methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Class variables are often used to store data or properties that should be shared among all instances of the class, such as a counter that tracks how many objects have been created.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Instance Variable\n",
        "An instance variable is a variable that is associated with a specific instance (object) of the class. Each instance has its own copy of the instance variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instance variables are typically used to store data that is specific to the instance of the class, such as a name or age for a Person object.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        " - Multiple inheritance is a feature in Python (and other object-oriented languages) where a class can inherit from more than one parent class. This allows a child class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple base classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, a class can inherit from multiple classes by simply passing multiple parent classes as arguments to the class definition.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.  Explain the purpose of â€˜â€™__str__â€™ and â€˜__repr__â€™ â€˜ methods in Python.\n",
        " - Purpose of __str__:\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal is to return a readable, concise string that describes the object in a way that makes sense to a user.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's mainly used for displaying the object to end-users, especially in print statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose of __repr__:\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal is to return a detailed and unambiguous string that fully describes the object, ideally in a format that could be passed to the eval() function to recreate the object (though this is not always possible).\n",
        "\n",
        "It is used by the repr() function and in interactive sessions when an object is displayed in the console.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the â€˜super()â€™ function in Python?\n",
        " - ðŸ”¹ Significance of the super() Function in Python\n",
        "The super() function in Python is used to call a method or constructor from a parent class (or superclass) in the child class (or subclass). It is primarily used in the context of inheritance and is a key part of multiple inheritance to ensure that methods from all parent classes are properly called.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        " - ðŸ”¹ Significance of the __del__ Method in Python\n",
        "The __del__ method in Python is a special method (also known as a dunder or magic method) that acts as a destructor for objects. It is called when an object is about to be destroyed or deleted. This method is typically used for cleaning up resources that are not automatically managed by Python, such as closing files, network connections, or freeing up other system resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "22.  What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        " - In Python, both @staticmethod and @classmethod are decorators used to define methods that are associated with the class itself, rather than an instance of the class. However, they have key differences in how they interact with the class and its instances.\n",
        "\n",
        " Definition: A @staticmethod is a method that does not take a reference to the instance (self) or the class (cls) as its first argument. It is essentially a method that behaves like a regular function, but belongs to the classâ€™s\n",
        " namespace.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Definition: A @classmethod is a method that takes a reference to the class (cls) as its first argument, instead of the instance (self). This means that the method can modify the class state (class variables), but cannot modify instance-specific data directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "23.  How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "      - Polymorphism is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. In Python, polymorphism primarily refers to the ability of different classes to define methods with the same name, and these methods can behave differently based on the class of the object calling them.\n",
        "      In Python, inheritance enables polymorphism. When a subclass inherits from a parent class, it can override or extend the methods of the parent class. Polymorphism allows different subclasses to provide their own specific behavior for methods defined in the parent class, without modifying the parent class itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        " - Method chaining is a programming technique in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where multiple method calls are made on the same object in a single line, one after another. This is possible because each method call returns the object itself (or another object), allowing you to call another method on the resulting object.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, method chaining is commonly used when you want to perform several actions on an object in a single line of code, making the code more concise and readable.\n",
        "\n",
        "25.  What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        " - ðŸ”¹ Purpose of the __call__ Method in Python\n",
        "The __call__ method in Python is a special method (also known as a dunder method, short for \"double underscore\") that allows an instance of a class to be called like a regular function. In other words, when you define the __call__ method in a class, you can invoke an instance of that class as if it were a function.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is often referred to as callable objects in Python. It provides a way to make an object behave like a function, which can be useful in scenarios where you want to treat objects dynamically.\n",
